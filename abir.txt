Self-Healing Systems: AI frameworks for detecting vulnerabilities and autonomously applying patches.

Smart Bins
Create IoT-enabled smart bins that:
Detect waste types and segregate automatically.
Notify waste collection services when full, optimizing pickup schedules.

Digital Twin for Personalized Treatment


waste management:
In hospitals or large office complexes, a pipeline-based smart waste system could automatically sort and transport 
medical, recyclable, and general waste to different processing units, improving efficiency and hygiene compared to 
using multiple stationary bins.
